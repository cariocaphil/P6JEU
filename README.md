Board Wars
=================

**Board Wars** is a simple game for 2 players that has been developed as part of a frontend development course.

To run the game, we suggest you simply download or clone the project.

Then, if you are using *Visual Studio Code*, you can install the following extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), right click the index HTML file and click on OPEN WITH LIVE SERVER. This will launch the game on a local development server and you are ready to go. Have Fun!

### ‚Üê App.test.js

Having node installed, a small cypress test can be run with the command:
`npx cypress run`

And assuming that your live server is running, the tests should pass :-)
